scons-arguments
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ptomulik/scons-arguments.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ptomulik/scons-arguments)

Welcome to ``scons-arguments``.

This scons extension enables one to easily define scons command-line variables
and options. It provides a concept of "Argument" which correlates up to three
entities:

- command line option (e.g. ``scons --prefix=/usr/bin``),
- command line variable (e.g. ``scons PREFIX=/usr/bin``),
- construction variable in SConscript (e.g. env['PREFIX']).

INSTALLATION
------------

There are two method for installation:

### Installation by simple copy

Copy recursively the entire directory ``SConsArguments`` to your
``site_scons/`` directory

    cp -r scons-arguments/SConsArguments your/projects/site_scons/

### Installation as a submodule in git-based projects

Add the repository as a submodule to your project

```shell
git submodule add git://github.com/ptomulik/scons-arguments.git 3rd/scons-arguments
```

In your `site_scons/site_init.py` add the following lines:

```python
# site_scons/site_init.py
import sys
sys.path.append(Dir('#3rd/scons-arguments').abspath)
```

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

### API documentation

API documentation can be generated from the top level directory with the
following command (see also requirements below)

```shell
scons api-doc
```

The generated documentation will be written to ``build/doc/api``.

#### Requirements for api-doc

To generate API documentation, you may need following packages on your system:

  * python-epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>
  * python-docutils <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils>
  * python-pygments <http://pygments.org/>

Note, that epydoc is no longer developed, last activities in the project date
to 2008. The pip epydoc package 3.0.1 is not usable with current versions of
python. Fortunately Debian package is patched to work with current python.
Please use the ``python-epydoc`` package installed with apt-get.

### User documentation

User documentation can be generated from the top level directory with the
following command (see also requirements below)

```shell
scons user-doc
```
The generated documentation is located in ``build/doc/user``.

#### Requirements for user-doc

To generate user's documentation, you'll need following packages on your
system:

  * docbook5-xml <http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/>
  * xsltproc <ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/>
  * imagemagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/>

You also must install locally the SCons docbook tool by Dirk Baechle:
