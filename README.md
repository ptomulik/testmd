##Overview

This module provides a **bsdportconfig** resource which ensures that certain
build options are set (or unset) for a given BSD port.

##Module Description

The **bsdportconfig** module helps to configure BSD ports. Installation and
deinstallaton of FreeBSD ports is handled very well by `package` resource
provided by core **puppet**, however there is no way to provide configuration
options for ports (no `"make config"` stage). This module helps to ensure, that
certain configuration options are set (or unset) for certain ports.

The module supports only the **on/off** options.

Source code is available at: https://github.com/ptomulik/puppet-bsdportconfig

##Setup

###What Bsdportconfig affects

This module affects:

* config options for given ports, it's done by modifying
  `$port_dbdir/*/options`, where `$port_dbdir='/var/db/ports'` by default.

###Setup Requirements

You may need to enable **pluginsync** in your *puppet.conf*.

###Beginning with Bsdportconfig

Ensure that 'www/apache22' is configured with LDAP and CGID modules:

    bsdportconfig {'www/apache22': options => { LDAP => on, CGID => on } }

Ensure that 'www/apache22' is configured without CGID module:

    bsdportconfig {'www/apache22': options => { CGID => off } }

Note, that the resource modifies only the options listed in `options`
parameter. Other options are left unaltered (even if they currently differ from
their default values defined by port's Makefile).

Install 'www/apache22' package with LDAP module enabled:

    bsdportconfig {'www/apache22': options => { LDAP => on }
    package { 'www/apache22': require => Bsdportconfig['www/apache22'] }

##Usage

###Resource type: `bsdportconfig`

####Parameters within `bsdportconfig:

#####`ensure`

Ensure that port configuration is synchronized with the resource. Accepts
value: `insync`. Defaults to `insync`.

#####`name`

The package name. It has the same meaning and syntax as the `$name` parameter
to the **package** resource from core puppet (for the **ports** provider).

#####`options`

Options for the package. This is a hash with keys being option names and values
being `'on'`/`'off`' strings.

#####`portsdir`

Location of the ports tree (absolute path). This is */usr/ports* on FreeBSD and
OpenBSD, and */usr/pkgsrc* on NetBSD. 

#####`port_dbdir`

Directory where the result of configuring options are stored. Defaults to
*/var/db/ports*.

##Limitations

Currently tested on FreeBSD only.
