##Overview

Puppet utilities to interact with package repositories. Simplify tasks such
as obtaining lists of packages available for installation, their versions,
installation candidates and so on. This plugin may be handy, if you need to
implement facts describing packages available to agents' via their package
repositories.

##Module Description

The module provides means to access meta-information from package repositories
such as apt or yum. The supported operations currently include: 

  * listing available packages,
  * listing available package(s) versions,
  * retrieving full package records (containing descriptions, etc.),
  * determining installation candidate (version) for a given package,

The module currently supports the following providers:

  * apt, aptitude (Debian),
  * ports (FreeBSD)

Utilities provided by `repoutil` are devoted to developers of other modules,
and are not intended to be used directly from puppet manifests. 

##Setup

###What repoutil affects

  * it executes CLI commands necessary to query information from package
    repositories. The exact list of commands being executed depend on agent's OS
    and module's usage, but generally they should be regarded as harmless. 
    
    The following CLI commands are currently used by `repoutil`'s: 

    - on Debian: `apt-cache show|policy`, `aptitude show`, 
    - on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD:  `make -C /path/to/ports search`,

###Setup Requirements 

You may need to enable **pluginsync** in your *puppet.conf*.

###Beginning with repoutil

Let's say, you're developing your custom fact or resource type and you need to
characterize some packages existing in your package repository. The repoutil
plugin may be used to obtain meta-data describing these packages.

The preliminary step to use repoutil utilities is to include its module file:

    require 'puppet/util/repoutil'

Once the module file is included you may obtain reference to repoutil provider
(call it `repo`), which implements access to a particular repository type. For
example, apt `repo` may be obtained as follows:

    repo = Puppet::Util.repoutil(:apt)
 
The `:apt` utility is **suitable** for use on Debian or Ubuntu. For other
systems we should choose other facility. The most universal way is to load
default utility for current environment: 

    repo = Puppet::Util.defaultrepoutil

Once we have obtained `repo`, we may request information from that repository.
For example, we may wish to list all packages with names starting with
'apache':

    apaches = repo.packages_with_prefix('apache')

This would return an array of all available package names starting with
'apache' prefix, for example:

    ["apache2-utils", "apache2-mpm-prefork", "apache2-mpm-worker", ... ]

There are also other methods. For example:

    apache_versions = repo.package_versions_with_prefix('apache')

would return a hash with keys being the package names (from previous example)
and arrays of available versions as values:

    { 
      "apache2"             => ["2.4.6-2", "2.2.22-13"],
      "apache2-mpm-prefork" => ["2.4.6-2", "2.2.22-13"], 
      "apache2-mpm-itk"     => ["2.4.6-2", "2.2.22-13"],
      . . .
    }

To retrieve full records from package database (including version, description,
and other information) you may use:

    apache_records = repo.package_records_with_prefix('apache')

This would return a hash such as the following:

    { 
      "apache2" => {
        "2.4.6-2" => {
          "Package"=>"apache2",
          "Version"=>"2.4.6-2",
          "Installed-Size"=>"481",
          . . .
        },
        "2.2.22-13" => {
          "Package"=>"apache2",
          "Version"=>"2.2.22-13",
          "Installed-Size"=>"29",
          . . .
        }
      },

      "apache2-mpm-prefork => {
        . . .
      },

      .
      .
      .
    }

Of course, we may operate on exact package names, that is we may request
information for one particular package. For example, in order to obtain
available package versions we call:

    apache2_versions = repo.package_versions('apache2')

This method returns an array, such as `["2.4.6-2", "2.2.22-13"]` or `nil` (if
there is no database entry for the package).

To see the installation candidate for package (what version of the package
would be installed if we requested package installation/upgrade), we do:

    apache2_candidates = repo.package_candidate('apache2')

This returns a string (e.g. `"2.4.6-2"`) or `nil` (if there is no such package
in repository).


To retrieve full records for available package versions we type:

    apache2_records = repo.package_records('apache2')

This should return a hash such as:

    {
      "2.4.6-2" => 
      {
        "Package"=>"apache2",
        "Version"=>"2.4.6-2",
        "Installed-Size"=>"481",
        . . .
      },
      "2.2.22-13" => 
      {
        "Package"=>"apache2",
        "Version"=>"2.2.22-13",
        "Installed-Size"=>"29",
        . . .
      }
    }

In case there is no such package in repository, `nil` is returned.

##Usage

The module consists of two ruby classes: 

  - [`Puppet::Util::RepoUtil`](#methods-within-puppetutilrepoutil-class) -
    represents single utility,
  - [`Puppet::Util::RepoUtils`](#methods-within-puppetutilrepoutils-class) -
    represents the "registry" of available utilities,

and few [shorthand module-level methods](#methods-within-puppetutil-module).

The [`Puppet::Util::RepoUtil`](#methods-within-puppetutilrepoutil-class) class
abstracts CLI commands used to access repository cache/database and is
inherited by several sub-classes implementing particular types of repositories
(providers). The user actually operates on providers, that is on subclasses of
`Puppet::Util::RepoUtil`. Each *repoutil provider* shall correspond to an
appropriate [package provider](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#package)
from puppet core (note, not all puppet providers are covered here). For
example, there is `Puppet::Util::RepoUtils::Apt` class (`:apt` repoutil) which
corresponds to `:apt` package provider. To retrieve appropriate repoutil, you
should use one of the methods from `Puppet::Util::RepoUtils` [described in
reference](#provider-management). [Methods within
`Puppet::Util::RepoUtil`](#methods-within-puppetutilrepoutil-class) (and
descendants) may be used to operate on a single repository.

[Methods within `Puppet::Util::RepoUtils`](#methods-within-puppetutilrepoutils-class)
are twofold. Some of them are provided to 
[manage providers](#provider-management). These include
[`newrepoutil`](#newrepoutilname-options---block-1) (to implement new
providers), [`unrepoutil`](#unrepoutilname) (to unregister particular
provider), [`repoutils`](#repoutils-1) (to retrieve all available providers),
[`suitablerepoutils`](#suitablerepoutils-1) (to retrieve all the providers
suitable for the current environment), [`defaultrepoutil`](#defaultrepoutil-1)
to get provider default to current environment and
[`repoutil`](#repoutilname-1) (to retrieve particular provider). Other methods
within `Puppet::Util::RepoUtils` may be used to perform 
[collective operations](#collective-operations-on-repositories)
on repositories. For example, [`package_candidates`](#package_candidatespackages)
may be used to retrieve lists of package candidates known to all the suitable
package repositories (this yields a hash of the form `{:apt => {...}, :aptitude
=> {...}, ...}`).

### Extending repoutil

#### Adding new utility (provider)

The new utility may be defined by using `Puppet::Util.newrepoutil` method. 

  - `Puppet::Util.newrepoutil(name, options = {}, &block)`

If you're extending `repoutil` module, the source code of the new provider (say
`foo`) should go to file 

  - `lib/puppet/util/repoutil/foo.rb`

You may also consider adding `:foo` entry to `utils` array in 

  - `spec/unit/puppet/util/repoutil_spec.rb`

to enable common unit tests for your provider. Specific tests should be
implemented in

  - `spec/unit/puppet/util/repoutil/foo_spec.rb`

When defining new utility, one should define following methods in the block
provided to [`newrepoutil`](#newrepoutilname-options--block-1):

  - `self.package_name_regexp`
  - `self.package_prefix_regexp`
  - `self.package_name_to_pattern(package)`
  - `self.package_prefix_to_pattern(prefix)`
  - `self.retrieve_candidates(pattern)`
  - `self.retrieve_records(pattern)`

To configure suitability, confines, defaults etc., use [same methods as in
normal providers](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/provider_development.html).

Example template for a repoutil `foo` is presented below:

    # lib/puppet/util/repoutil/foo.rb
    module Puppet::Util
      newrepoutil(:foo) do
        commands :foocmd => '/usr/bin/foo'

        def self.package_name_regexp
          # this is tool-specific, check if this pattern fits your needs
          /[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\.+-]+/ 
        end

        def self.package_prefix_regexp
          # this is tool-specific, check if this pattern fits your needs
          /(?:[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\.+-]*)?/ 
        end

        # escape characters that could be interpreted as meta-characters
        # by CLI commands used for repository lookups
        def self.escape_package_name(package)
          # this is tool-specific, check if this pattern fits your needs
          package.gsub(/([\.\+])/) {|c| '\\' + c}
        end

        # escape characters that could be interpreted as meta-characters
        # by CLI commands used for repository lookups
        def self.escape_package_prefix(prefix)
          # this is tool-specific, check if this pattern fits your needs
          prefix.gsub(/([\.\+])/) {|c| '\\' + c}
        end

        def self.package_name_to_pattern(package)
          # this is tool-specific, check if this conversion fits your needs
          "^#{escape_package_name(package)}$"
        end

        def self.package_prefix_to_pattern(prefix)
          # this is tool-specific, check if this conversion fits your needs
          "^#{escape_package_prefix(prefix)}"
        end

        def self.show_candidates(pattern)
          # adjust to the actual syntax of your CLI command
          foocmd 'candidates',  pattern 
        end

        def self.show_records(pattern)
          # adjust to the actual syntax of your CLI command
          foocmd 'records', pattern
        end

        def self.retrieve_candidates(pattern)
          output = show_candidates(pattern).chomp
          # now, extract candidates from output, update candidates_cache and
          # return the extracted candidates
        end

        def self.retrieve_records(pattern)
          output = show_records(pattern).chomp
          # now, extract records from output, update records_cache and
          # return the extracted records
        end
      end
    end
