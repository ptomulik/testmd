INVENTORY
=========

Simple stackholding utility.

Overview
--------

The purpose of *INVENTORY* is to keep track of assets (tangible assets,
materials, etc.), owners, purchases, related documents, formal procedures
and other aspects of stocktaking. The whole project consists of three
components

- `MySQL`_ database to keep basic information and relations between objects,
- an on-disk repository where attachments and other files are stored. The
  `MySQL`_ database only keeps track on file locations and physically files are
  stored in this repository,
- `LibreOffice Base`_ project named **inventory.odb** -- it's purpose is to
  provide user interface to the MySQL.
