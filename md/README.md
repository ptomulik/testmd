Docker container with [doctum](https://github.com/code-lts/doctum/)
documentation generator.

## Image versions

@MICROBADGES@

## Features

With this container you can:

  - build documentation once and exit,
  - build documentation once and then serve it with http server,
  - build documentation continuously (rebuilding when sources change),
  - build documentation continuously and serve it at the same time.

The default behavior is to build continuously and serve at the same time.

## Quick example

Assume we have the following file hierarchy (the essential here is assumption
that php source files are found under `src`, also we expect the documentation
to be written-out somewhere under `docs`)

```console
user@@pc:$ tree .
.
|-- docs
`-- src
    `-- Foo
        `-- Bar.php
```

### Running with docker

Run it as follows

```console
user@@pc:$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/code" -p 8001:8001 -u "`id -u`:`id -g`" phptailors/doctum
```

### Running with docker-compose

In the top level directory create `docker-compose.yml` containing the following

```yaml
version: '3'
# ....
services:
   # ...
   doctum:
      image: phptailors/doctum
      ports:
         - "8001:8001"
      volumes:
         - ./:/code
      user: "${MYUID:-1000}:${MYGID:-1000}"
      environment:
        - MYUID
        - MYGID
```

Then run

```console
user@@pc:$ MYUID=`id -u` MYGID=`id -g` docker-compose up doctum
```

### Results

Whatever method you chose to run the container, you shall see two new directories

```console
user@@pc:$ ls -d docs/*
docs/build docs/cache
```

The documentation is written to `docs/build/html/api`

```console
user@@pc:$ find docs -name 'index.html'
docs/build/html/api/index.html
```

As long as the container is running, the documentation is available at

  - <http://localhost:8001>.

## Customizing

Several parameters can be changed via environment variables, for example we can
change build to ``build/docs/api`` dir as follows

```console
user@@pc:$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/code" -p 8001:8001 -u "`id -u`:`id -g`"  -e DOCTUM_BUILD_DIR=build/docs/api phptailors/doctum
```

## Details

### Volume mount points exposed

  - `/code` - bind top level directory of your project here.

### Working directory

  - `/code`

### Files inside container

#### In `/usr/local/bin`

  - scripts which may be used as container's command:
      - `autobuild` - builds documentation continuously (watches
        source directory for changes),
      - `autoserve` - builds documentation continuously and runs
        http server,
      - `build` - builds documentation once and exits,
      - `serve` - builds source once and starts http server,
  - other files
      - `doctum-defaults` - sets `DEFAULT_DOCTUM_xxx` variables (default values
        for `DOCTUM_xxx` variables),
      - `doctum-env` - initializes `DOCTUM_xxx` variables,
      - `doctum-entrypoint` - provides an entry point for docker.

#### In `/etc/doctum`

  - `doctum.conf.php` - default configuration file for doctum.

### Build arguments & environment variables

The container defines several build arguments. Some of them are copied to
corresponding environment variables (E) within the running container. Some of
these environment variables are mutable (M) at runtime. The scripts, and the
configuration file `doctum.conf.php` respect most of these variables, so the
easiest way to adjust the container to your needs is to set environment
variables at runtime (`-e` flag to [docker](https://docker.com/)).
