### Description

Provides callback function that limits number of entries returned by
[@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest.js](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-paginate-rest.js).

The [paginate](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-paginate-rest.js#octokitpaginate)
method provided by [@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest.js](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-paginate-rest.js).
gathers all entries retrieved page-by-page and returns them as a single
array. The [octokit-paginate-rest-limit](https://github.com/ptomulik/octokit-paginate-rest-limit)
allows to reduce the number of entries returned (and pages retrieved) when
only few first records are required.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Octokit } from "@octokit/core";
import { paginateRest, PaginatingEndpoints } from "@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest";
import { limit, MapFunction } from "@ptomulik/octokit-paginate-rest-limit";

const MyOctokit = Octokit.plugin(paginateRest);
const octokit = new MyOctokit();

type T = { data: { tag_name: string }[] };

// Retrieve (no more than) 2 releases and print their names.
octokit.paginate(
  "GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases",
  {owner: "octokit", repo: "plugin-paginate-rest.js"},
  limit(2) as MapFunction<T, T["data"]>
).then((releases) => {
  console.log(releases.map((release) => release.tag_name));
});
```

```typescript
import { Octokit } from "@octokit/core";
import { paginateRest, PaginatingEndpoints } from "@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest";
import { limit, MapFunction } from "@ptomulik/octokit-paginate-rest-limit";

const MyOctokit = Octokit.plugin(paginateRest);
const octokit = new MyOctokit();

type T = { data: { tag_name: string }[] };

// Retrieve (no more than) 2 releases and print their names.
octokit
  .paginate(
    "GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases",
    { owner: "octokit", repo: "plugin-paginate-rest.js" },
    limit(2, ({ data }: T) => data.map((release) => release.tag_name))
  )
  .then((names) => {
    console.log(names);
  });
```
