```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        name: "*"
```

Select release(s) with name == "specific"

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        name: "specific"
```

Select releases whose names match a regular expession, the regular expession
may also contain flags

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        name: "/^v?5.3.1$/"
```

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        name: "/^latest$/i"
```

### tag\_name

Select releases whose tag names match given criteria. The parameter may be set
to a specific name, may be a regular expression (possibly with flags) or may be
missing or empty to allow any name (the same may be achieved by name to ``*``).


### draft

Value used to filter retrieved releases by draft status.

Allows selecting draft/non-draft releases. Suported values are ``false``,
``true`` and ``*``. If missing or empty, allows releases with any draft status.

### prerelease

Value used to filter retrieved releases by prerelease status.

Allows selecting prereleases/non-prereleases.Suported values are ``false``,
``true`` and ``*``. If missing or empty, allows releases with any draft status.

### sort

List of properties used for sorting the retrieved releases.

Comma-separated list of property names, each optionally followed by order
specifier - ``"A"``|``"ASC"`` (ascending) or ``"D"``|``"DSC"``|``"DESC"``
(descending). Used to sort the resultant array.'

### Examples:

Sort by ``id``.

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        sort: 'id'
```

Sort by ``id`` in descendant order.

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        sort: 'id DSC'
```

Sort by ``draft`` status in ascendant order (``false`` goes first) then by
``name`` in descendant order.

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        sort: 'draft = ASC, name = DSC'
```

### order

Default sort order.

Allowed values are ``"A"``|``"ASC"`` (ascending) or ``"D"``|``"DSC"``|``"DESC"``
(descending).

### select

List of properties to be returned.

List of properties to be included in each entry of the result. This should
be a space or comma separated list of keywords. If missing or empty, allows all
properties (the same may be achieved with ``"*"``).

#### Examples:

Select only ``name`` and ``url``

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        select: 'name, url'
```

### slice

The range of entries to be returned.

Determines the range of entries to be sliceed after sorting.

### Examples

Return all entries

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: 'all'
```

Return first entry

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: 'first'
```

Return up to 3 first entries

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: 'first 3'
```

Return last entry

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: 'last'
```

Return up to 3 last entries

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: 'last 3'
```

Return entries 2 to 4 (zero-based indices)

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: '2 ... 4'
```

Return entries from 2 to end of array

```yaml
use: ptomulik/get-releases
    with:
        slice: '2 ...'
```

## Outputs

### json

### base64

The ``json`` string encoded in BASE64.

### count

Number of entries on output.

## Example usage

### Get & Print Releases

The following workflow prints to console releases retrieved from remote
repository. The workflow may be triggered
[manually](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/),
and most of the action's inputs may be provided via HTML form.

Note that ``work_dispatch`` only works on default branch.
