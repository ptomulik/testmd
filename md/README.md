# korowai/docker-sami

Docker container with [sami](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami/)
documentation generator. The container is designed to build PHP API
documentation for [Korowai](https://github.com/korowai/korowai/) and
[Korowai Framework](https://github.com/korowai/framework/) out of the
box. It may be easily adjusted to support other projects.

## Features

With this container you can:

  - build documentation once and exit,
  - build documentation once and then serve it with http server,
  - build documentation continuously (rebuilding when sources change),
  - build documentation continuously and serve it at the same time.

The default behavior is to build continuously and serve at the same
time.

## Quick example

Assume we have the following file hierarchy (the essential here is
assumption that php source files are found under `src`, also we expect
the documentation to be written-out somewhere under `docs`)

```console
user@pc:$ tree .
.
|-- docs
`-- src
    `-- Foo
        `-- Bar.php
```

### Running with docker

Run it as
follows

```console
user@pc:$ docker run -v "$(pwd):/home/sami/project" -p 8001:8001 --rm korowai/sami
```

### Running with docker-compose

In the top level directory create `docker-compose.yml` containing the
following

```yaml
version: '3'
# ....
services:
   # ...
   sami:
      image: korowai/sami
      ports:
         - "8001:8001"
      volumes:
         - ./:/home/sami/project
```

Then run

```console
user@pc:$ docker-compose up sami
```

### Results

Whatever method you chose to run the container, you shall see two new
directories

```console
user@pc:$ ls -d docs/*
docs/build docs/cache
```

The documentation is written to `docs/build/html/api`

```console
user@pc:$ find docs -name 'index.html'
docs/build/html/api/index.html
```

As long as the container is running, the documentation is available at

  - <http://localhost:8001>.

## Customizing

Several parameters can be changed via environment variables, for
example

```console
user@pc:$ docker run -v "$(pwd):/home/sami/project" -p 8001:8001 --rm -e SAMI_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/build korowai/sami
```

## Details

### Volume mount points exposed

  - `/home/sami/project` - bind top level directory of your project
    here.

### Working directory

  - `/home/sami/project`

### User running the commands

Commands are executed within container by container's internal user
called `sami`. By default it has `UID=1000` and `GID=1000`, thus all the
generated files will have owner with `UID=1000` and `GID=1000`.

The container may be rebuilt with custom UID and GID by setting build
arguments `SAMI_UID` and `SAMI_GID`.

### Files inside container

#### In `/usr/local/bin`

  - scripts which may be used as container's command:
      - `sami-autobuild` - builds documentation continuously (watches
        source directory for changes),
      - `sami-autoserve` - builds documentation continuously and runs
        http server,
      - `sami-build` - builds documentation once and exits,
      - `sami-serve` - builds source once and starts http server,
  - other files
      - `sami-defaults` - initializes `SAMI_xxx` variables (default
        values),
      - `sami-entrypoint` - provides an entry point for docker.

#### In `/home/sami`

  - `sami.conf.php` - default configuration file for sami.

### Build arguments & environment variables

The container defines several build arguments which are copied to
corresponding environment variables within the running container. All
the arguments/variables have names starting with `SAMI_` prefix. All the
`sami-*` scripts, and the configuration file `sami.conf.php` respect
these variables, so the easiest way to adjust the container to your
needs is to set environment variables (`-e` flag to
[docker](https://docker.com/)). There are three exceptions currently --
`SAMI_UID`, `SAMI_GID` and `SAMI_PORT` must be defined at build time, so
they may only be changed via docker's build
arguments.

| Argument             | Default Value            | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| SAMI\_UID            | 1000                     | UID of the user running commands within the container. |
| SAMI\_GID            | 1000                     | GID of the user running commands within the container. |
| SAMI\_CONFIG         | /home/sami/sami.conf.php | Path to the config file for sami.                      |
| SAMI\_PROJECT\_TITLE | API Documentation        | Title for the generated documentation.                 |
| SAMI\_SOURCE\_DIR    | src                      | Top-level directory with the PHP source files.         |
| SAMI\_BUILD\_DIR     | docs/build/html/api      | Where to output the generated documentation.           |
| SAMI\_CACHE\_DIR     | docs/cache/html/api      | Where to write cache files.                            |
| SAMI\_SERVER\_PORT   | 8001                     | Port numer (within container) for the http server.     |
| SAMI\_SOURCE\_REGEX  | `\.\(php\\|txt\\|rst\)$` | Regular expression for source files' discovery.        |
